        <p>My name is Ilene Cohen.  I have 2 children, Jamie who is 28 years old and Craig who is 24 years old.  
            I am divorced and live by myself loving it.  I have a boyfriend Barry, who I met online, who is a great guy 
            and makes me feel like I'm 25. I also have a dog named Cammie who is a Cathoula mix. 
            I love taking her on long walks.
        </p>
        <p>I love to try new and adventurous things.  I recently took a vacation to the Western Mediterranean by myself.  
            I recently went to Zion National Park and Bryce Canyon where I did the most strenuous hikes, 
            one was in a river and the water was freezing.
